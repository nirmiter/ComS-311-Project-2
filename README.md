Testing infection times of computers using lists

This was an assignment for my algorithms course where we would establish times that two computers connected. From there we would create
a graph of sorts that detailed these connections for the whole system. At that point, you would query the system that if 
a computer got infected at a specific time, to see if another computer might have been potentially infected if this were the case.
